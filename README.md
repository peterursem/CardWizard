# The Cut-erator

A web based tool that allows the user to easily upload and print images in layouts compatible with the Duplo DocuCutter CC-229. The program currently includes support for 3.5"x2", 3.5"x5", 4"x6", and 5"x7". in the future I will add support for the creaser function on the machine for 10"x7", and 3.5"x5" layouts.
